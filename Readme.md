# Exact Facts / Dumb Over Under

This is currently extremely dumb because it's hard coded to a .json with 100 facts. In the future we could tie it to AI and maybe make it more fun. Could also save Usernames and scores locally.

## How to run

`nvm use --lts`
`npm run dev` # Starts the server

`npm run build` # Builds the project

Currently deploys to Netlify at https://exactfacts.netlify.app when pushed to Github.

# log

- 2024-July-09: Initial commit, added 400 facts to the json file, published and shared to friends, added Google Analytics.
